# htb-labs

This repo documents my journey through Hack The Box labs — from beginner to advanced.  
As an AI & ML Engineer and Cybersecurity Enthusiast, I’m learning to ethically exploit systems, understand real-world vulnerabilities, and grow as a security researcher.

##  Why I’m Doing This

- To sharpen my offensive security skills  
- To learn by doing — hands-on labs only  
- To build a solid foundation in ethical hacking  
- For educational use only 🧷

##  Structure

Each folder contains:
- A full write-up (`README.md`)
- Any exploit files or automation used
- (Optional) screenshots for clarity

## Follow My Journey

If you're learning too, feel free to star, fork, or reach out.  
Let’s grow together — one shell at a time. 🐚
